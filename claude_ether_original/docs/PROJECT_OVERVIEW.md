# Claude Ether Project Overview

## Introduction
Claude Ether is a high-performance, cross-platform networking application designed for reliable socket-based communication with robust thread management and platform abstraction.

## Core Features
- Multi-threaded client/server architecture
- Platform-agnostic design (Windows, POSIX, macOS)
- Configurable logging system
- Thread coordination for socket communications
- Robust error handling and resource management

## Architecture

### Platform Layer
The platform abstraction layer provides a consistent interface across different operating systems:
- Thread and synchronization primitives
- Socket operations
- File system access
- Error handling
- See: [Platform Migration Guide](MIGRATION.md)

### Threading System
Advanced thread management system supporting:
- Thread groups for coordinated operations
- Resource lifecycle management
- Message routing between threads
- See: [Thread Coordination Design](THREAD_COORDINATION.md)

### Communication System
Socket-based networking with:
- Client and server modes
- Asynchronous I/O
- Connection management
- Data routing

### Logging System
Configurable logging infrastructure:
- Per-thread log files
- Multiple output destinations
- Configurable granularity
- Timestamp precision control

## Configuration
- INI-style configuration file
- Runtime configuration options
- Thread suppression for debugging
- Log level and destination control

## Key Components

### Client Manager
- Manages client connections
- Spawns communication threads
- Handles reconnection logic
- Resource cleanup

### Server Manager
- Accepts incoming connections
- Creates thread groups per client
- Load balancing
- Connection monitoring

### Thread Registry
- Global thread management
- Group coordination
- Resource tracking
- Shutdown sequencing

### Platform Utilities
- Random number generation
- String operations
- Path handling
- Console management
- Signal handling

## Build System
- CMake-based build
- Cross-platform support
- Debug/Release configurations
- Platform-specific optimizations

## Development Guidelines
1. All platform-specific code goes through platform layer
2. Thread coordination via documented patterns
3. Resource cleanup handled at appropriate levels
4. Error handling must be comprehensive
5. Configuration changes don't require recompilation

## Future Roadmap
1. Enhanced Protocol Support
   - WebSocket integration
   - Protocol plugins
   - Custom protocol definitions

2. Security Features
   - TLS/SSL support
   - Authentication mechanisms
   - Encryption options

3. Monitoring & Management
   - Performance metrics
   - Remote management
   - Health monitoring

4. Extended Platform Support
   - Additional POSIX variants
   - Mobile platforms
   - Embedded systems
