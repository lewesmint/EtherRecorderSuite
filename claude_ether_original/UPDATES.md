# Project Updates & Progress Tracking

## Current Context
- Working with platform layer migration from `claude_ether_original`
- Reviewing error handling implementation in `platform_layer/inc/platform_error.h`
- Migration involves splitting monolithic `platform_utils.h` into specialized headers

## Key Files Referenced
- `platform_layer/MIGRATION.md`
- `platform_layer/README.md`
- `claude_ether_original/inc/platform_utils.h`
- `platform_layer/inc/platform_error.h`

## Progress
1. Initial review of error handling system
   - Comprehensive error domains
   - Detailed error codes per domain
   - Error information structure
   - Platform-agnostic error reporting

## Next Steps
[Awaiting your direction on what to focus on next]


Current Status - Platform Layer Migration
We are currently refactoring the platform abstraction layer, moving from the original monolithic platform_utils.h to a more modular design. Key progress:
Currently working on resolving circular dependencies between header files:
Moving  PlatformErrorCode enum from platform_error.h to platform_defs.h
Restructuring platform_error.h to depend on platform_defs.h
Completed files so far:
platform_defs.h (in progress, needs review)
Basic directory structure established
Migration guide documentation
Next steps:
Complete platform_error.h restructuring
Review error code organization
Continue with other platform-specific headers
Implement corresponding source files
Key files to reference:
Original:  claude_ether_original/inc/platform_utils.h
New:  platform_layer/inc/platform_defs.h
New:  platform_layer/inc/platform_error.h
Migration strategy:
Moving from monolithic to modular design
Maintaining backward compatibility where possible
Improving error handling and type safety
Adding proper documentation
Would you like me to add any other details to this status update?
